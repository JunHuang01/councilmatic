Keeping up with your city council can at times be difficult with all of the
issues addressed and bills proposed, and for many, only a fraction of the
activity is relevant to them â€” either because of topic or location.
*Councilmatic!* makes accessing legislative data as easy as checking your email
or reading a blog.

See *Councilmatic!* in action in:

* [Philadelphia](http://philly.councilmatic.org/)
  
  > Before a bill can be enacted by Council, it must be referred by the
  > President of Council to an appropriate standing committee of Council,
  > considered at a public hearing and public meeting, reported out by the
  > committee, printed as reported by the committee, distributed to the members
  > of Council, *and made available to the public*.
